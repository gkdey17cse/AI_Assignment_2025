HW0 Turing Paper: Gour Krishna Dey gour24035@iiitd.ac.in 

In Turing's discussion of learning machines, what concepts does he draw parallels with to explain the learning process?

 The evolution of species through natural selection.

 The growth of a crystal from a seed.

✓The development of a child's mind through education.

 The construction of a building from blueprints.


In Turing's refutation the objection that a machine 'can only do what they are told', and so cannot 'think', what analogy does he use to illustrate the concept of a 'supercritical' machine, i.e., emergent behaviour, or the whole being more than its parts?

✓An atomic pile reaching critical mass.

 A piano string struck by a hammer.

 The layers of an onion.

 A child's mind developing over time.


Turing discusses different objections to the idea of thinking machines.  Which of the following objections does he address and attempt to refute?

 The argument that machines lack consciousness and subjective experience.

✓The argument that machines lack the capacity for surprise or originality.

✓The argument from the physical differences between electrical machines and the human nervous system.

✓The argument that machines cannot learn or adapt to new situations.


What is the significance of Godel's Theorem in the context of Turing's argument, according to him?

 It proves that machines are fundamentally incapable of original thought.

✓It demonstrates limitations in the capabilities of discrete-state machines, but does not necessarily imply similar limitations for human intellect.

 It supports the theological objection by showing the inherent limitations of a created entity.

 It highlights the importance of continuous-state machines in mimicking human intelligence.
