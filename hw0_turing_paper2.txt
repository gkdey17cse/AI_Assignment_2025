HW0 Turing Paper: Gour Krishna Dey gour24035@iiitd.ac.in 

Turing discusses different objections to the idea of thinking machines.  Which of the following objections does he address and attempt to refute?

✓The argument that machines lack consciousness and subjective experience.

✓The argument that machines lack the capacity for surprise or originality.

✓The argument from the physical differences between electrical machines and the human nervous system.

✓The argument that machines cannot learn or adapt to new situations.


What is the significance of Godel's Theorem in the context of Turing's argument, according to him?

 It proves that machines are fundamentally incapable of original thought.

✓It demonstrates limitations in the capabilities of discrete-state machines, but does not necessarily imply similar limitations for human intellect.

 It supports the theological objection by showing the inherent limitations of a created entity.

 It highlights the importance of continuous-state machines in mimicking human intelligence.


What was the original 'imitation game' on which Turing modelled his 'test for intelligence'?

 A party game where two people, hidden from the audience and communicating only via written means, debate a topic and the audience judges who has won the debate.

 A party game where two people, hidden from the audience and communicating only via written means, try to convince the judge that one is more intelligent than the other.

✓A party game where a man and a woman, hidden from the audience and communicating only via written means, try to convince the judge that each is of the opposite gender that who they realy are.

 A party game where two people, hidden from the audience and communicating only via written means, try to convince the judge that they are human and not machines.


What are the key limitations of discrete-state machines as discussed by Turing, and how does he address potential objections related to these limitations?

✓Godel's theorem shows inherent limitations in their logical capabilities; Turing argues this doesn't inherently exclude human intelligence.

✓Their finite nature restricts their capacity for diverse and unpredictable behavior; Turing counters with the concept of scalable storage and learning.

✓They are therefore incapable of consciousness or subjective experience, negating the possibility of true intelligence; Turing argues that understanding consciousness is not neccesary to simulate intelligence in a machine.

✓They rely on deterministic rules, making true creativity impossible; Turing suggests that even machines relying on deterministic rules will eventually be able to compose poetry.
